<p>
  This hybrid theory-practice course invites students to consider artificial intelligence’s socio-political consequences through both technical and humanistic perspectives.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do society and culture inflect the way data and automation are designed and understood?</li>
  <li>In what ways do ubiquitous data, measurement, and surveillance reinforce tacit ideas about justice, identity, and even the nature of reality itself?</li>
  <li>What role does literature play in helping readers to understand the conditions shaping AI’s rise and to seek alternative possibilities to what might be assumed or elided now?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This course explores how fiction’s imagined worlds facilitate the reflection, and potential activism, that AI issues necessitate in relation to ethics, governance, and power. Readings pair fiction (novels, short stories, television, interactive media) with computer science and social science scholarship on AI and data, current events, and cultural criticism.
</p>
<p>
  We will juxtapose developing our foundation in theoretical frameworks with hands-on projects: creating datasets, visual storytelling with data, exploring AI training sets, traditional textual analysis, writing op-eds from the future, and interactive presentations. Synthesizing across disciplines, students will gain new critical models with which to think about technical systems’ risks and benefits, while developing the technical language and cultural vocabulary with which to propose alternatives.
</p>
<h3>What you learn</h3>
<p>
  The goal of the course is to provide you with opportunities to:
</p>
<ul>
  <!-- <li>Critically analyze the opinions and assertions of different scholars, writers, and texts.</li> -->
  <li>Formulate an interdisciplinary perspective on AI through multiple theoretical frameworks grounded in technical and humanistic perspectives.</li>
  <li>Identify, review, frame, and understand AI issues raised by various academic and popular sources.</li>
  <li>Construct and explain logical arguments about AI in relation to significant issues in studies of technology, data ethics, literature, culture, and society.</li>
  <li>Initiate and complete a creative research project that shows significant understanding of an aspect of how technology and speculative fiction intersect or mutually illuminate.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with peers to expand communication skills in listening and speaking clearly in discussion.</li>
  <!-- <li>Write clear, concise, and engaging pieces that express well-reasoned ideas and ask critical questions.</li> -->
  <li>Cultivate an understanding of media and technology literacy, as well as how big data is collected, processed, and used.</li>
  <li>Develop a personal vocabulary to analyze broad concepts: justice, data, and ethics, among others.</li>
  <li>Draw connections between fictive imaginings of different worlds and AI as a social artifact that has implications for humanity across cultures.</li>
</ul>
