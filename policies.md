# Course Policies

### Attendance

Attendance is mandatory; it is very important for both yourself and your classmates that you are present and participating. The success of our discussion-based class depends on your regular attendance and reliable participation. We need each other to show up on time, having completed the readings, prepared to engage constructively and respectfully with one another. If you have extenuating circumstances, communicate with us in a timely manner so that we can discuss how to proceed. Unexcused absences and repeated late arrivals will have a significant negative impact on your participation grade.

### Deadlines and Extensions

Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due to Canvas by 11:59pm on the date listed in the schedule. If, in advance of a deadline, you expect you will need an extension, please email us. Otherwise, late assignments will be docked 1/3 letter grade per day late, except for the final project, for which no extensions will be granted; it must be turned in by the due date.

### Email

The course email list and website will be used to distribute important info throughout the semester—from distributing handouts to providing updates on assignments or deadlines. We will respond to Mon-Fri emails within 48 hours, but mark time-sensitive emails in the subject.

### Office Hours

We encourage you to come to us with any questions. Office hours are by appointment. Please email both of us to make an appointment, and we'll reserve a meeting space.

### Personal Electronic Devices

We encourage students not to use personal electronic devices in class. While we understand that there are ways to use laptops that contribute to our shared goals, including for note-taking and accessibility reasons, much of the internet is [designed to be addictive](https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8544303/casino-slot-machine-gambling-addiction-psychology-mobile-games). Being distracted in class will negatively impact the experience of those around you, and we will only be able to have constructive discussions if we all bring our full attention and engagement to the table.

### Academic Integrity

Familiarize yourself with [Academic Integrity Resources](https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-code-conduct/academic-integrity-resources) at Tufts. If you have questions about anything related to citations, plagiarism, etc. or aren’t sure, please reach out to the [Academic Resource Center](https://students.tufts.edu/academic-advice-and-support/academic-resource-center).

### Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to talk with other students about the course and its readings, and to read each other’s work. In individual assignments, academic collaboration and external sources should be always cited.

### Diversity and Inclusion

We would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this:

If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Tufts records, please let us know!

If you feel like your participation in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. If something was said in class, by anyone, that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it.

### Classroom Accommodations

From the Office of Student Accessibility Services:

Tufts University values the diversity of our students, staff, and faculty, recognizing the important contribution each student makes to our unique community. Students with disabilities are assured that the Student Accessibility Services office will work with each student individually to ensure access to all aspects of student life. Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to all students through the provision of reasonable accommodations so that each student may access their curricula and achieve their personal and academic potential. If you have a disability that requires reasonable accommodations, please contact the Student Accessibility Services office at 617-627-4539, or through their email at Accessibility@tufts.edu, to make an appointment with the director to determine appropriate accommodations. Please be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision.
