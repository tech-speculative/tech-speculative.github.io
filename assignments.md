# Assignments

_This document is subject to change._

**Thoughtful participation:** Students will be responsible for leading (5-7 min. short presentation) part of discussion each week (sign up Week 1, starts Week 2). This entails summarizing the primary reading(s) briefly and offering questions to spark discussion.

**Create a Dataset (Due Week 3):** Mimi Onuoha’s art project “The Library of Missing Datasets” (assigned in Week 2) poses a provocative idea: what gets counted counts. In other words, the things that people choose to measure reflect what they value. In her project, she documents missing datasets: nobody has chosen to systematically measure gun trace data, or the cause of 2015 black church fires, etc. Think of a dataset that doesn’t exist, and create it. This can be anything from measuring yourself with a Fitbit for a certain amount of time, or taking the temperature of a patch of grass outside your room for a week, to doing research on mass shootings or adding evidence to other national conversations. You will present the dataset and submit a 500-word reflection on the process of creating it.

**Reflections on Teachable Machine (Due Week 5):** Google’s Teachable Machine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is an online application that allows you to train a simple image-recognition AI without coding. Teach the machine to recognize some simple facial states or hand gestures. Then, find a friend and have them try to get the machine to recognize the same faces and gestures (without adding new training data). Please write a 500-word reflection on the process.

**Final Project Proposal (Due Week 8):** Write a project proposal and an annotated bibliography of 8-10 sources toward a creative research project that shows significant understanding of an aspect of themes we’ve explored in the course. You work individually or collaborate (no more than 3 per group), but each person’s contributions should be made clear. We will provide an assessment rubric for the final project and meet with you to discuss your ideas. This project is intentionally flexible in approach, and more information will follow throughout the semester. Possible forms for the final project may include but not be limited to: a research paper; web-based interactive storytelling or visualization; a substantive piece of speculative fiction; a design of a speculative alternative to an extant AI system; an ethnographic or oral history project; an interview-style piece or podcast; a self-defined creative project that leverages your unique talents!

**Op-ed from the Future (Week 11):** It’s the year 2059. In the style of The New York Times series Op-Eds From the Future, write a 500-1200 word op-ed about a technology that has become pervasive in society and the risks and benefits associated with it. Example: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/opinion/ted-chiang-future-genetic-engineering.html.

**Final Project (Due Week 13).**
